## 1. Title — "WZRDMCP: The Transaction Fabric for AI Apps"
**Tagline:** *Route, run, and scale AI workloads with enterprise guardrails.*

---

## 2. Problem
- Teams ship AI features, but hit **latency, cost, and reliability** walls at scale.
- Vendors change; economics drift; compliance is hard; examples rarely productionize.

---

## 3. Solution (What is WZRDMCP?)
- A **multi-model control plane** that standardizes transactions across vendors.
- **x402/ACP** baked in: deterministic repos, env-first keys, auditable flows.
- One SDK, policy-based routing, unified telemetry & billing.

---

## 4. Why Now
- Explosion of modality demand (video, 3D, speech).
- Enterprise procurement needs **guardrails + portability**.
- Cost pressure favors smart routing and reservations.

---

## 5. Product Overview
- **SDKs:** TS/Python (others on roadmap).
- **Primitives:** transactions, flows, quotas, policies, audits.
- **Surfaces:** API, CLI, connectors (cloud, SIEM, data warehouse).
- **Observability:** transaction spans, cost and latency analytics.

---

## 6. Architecture (High level)
- Ingress → Policy Engine (cost/SLA/geo) → Router → Providers → Result Bus.
- Async jobs with DLQ; idempotency; cache; rate-limiters; per-slug SLOs.
- Data plane with **redaction**, **PII tags**, **customer-held keys** optional.

---

## 7. Traction / Proof
**Note:** Seed this section with your stats as they grow.

Metrics to include:
- Number of slugs supported
- Example runs
- MAU builders
- Early lighthouse teams (logos)
- Baseline SLA/latency
- Cost/tx vs. naive routing

---

## 8. ICP & Segments
- **Core ICP:** Product & platform teams at Series B+ SaaS, media, e-commerce, gaming.
- **Secondary:** Agencies/SIs, model providers seeking distribution.

---

## 9. Use Cases
- Visual gen at scale (campaigns), video previews, personalized TTS, 3D assets, ASR pipelines.
- Internal automation (RAG + async jobs), batch renders, moderation.

---

## 10. Competitive Landscape
- **Alternatives:** Direct model APIs (single vendor), orchestration tools, observability plugins.
- **WZRDMCP edge:** policy routing, enterprise guardrails, cost controls, cross-modality, **transaction standard**.

---

## 11. Business Model & Pricing
- **Usage:** per-transaction bands by modality (text/audio/image/video/3D).
- **Enterprise:** reserved capacity (commit discounts), private endpoints, support SLAs.
- **Marketplace:** pass-through with margin, rev-share on OEM.

---

## 12. GTM Motion
- **PLG:** quickstarts, starter credits, copy-paste examples (this repo).
- **Sales-assist:** in-product contact and ROI calculators; SDRs for POCs.
- **Enterprise:** solution engineers + reference architectures; SOC2/ISO kits.

---

## 13. Partnerships (BizDev)
- **Model providers:** co-launches, pinned "LTS" slugs, joint benchmarks.
- **Clouds:** marketplace SKUs, private offers, committed-use bundles.
- **SIs/ISVs:** reference solutions, MDF, certification program.

---

## 14. Financials & Targets
- Q4'26 ≥ 120M tx/mo run-rate; blended GM ≥ 65%; NRR ≥ 125%; CAC payback ≤ 9 months.
- **Sensitivity:** routing efficiency +10% → GM +4–6 pts.

---

## 15. Roadmap & Milestones
See [WZRDMCP_ROADMAP.md](./WZRDMCP_ROADMAP.md) for detailed phases P0–P4.

Key milestones:
- SOC2 II (Q2'26)
- ISO 27001 (Q3'26)
- BYO-model (Q3'26)
- Marketplace GA (Q2'26)

---

## 16. The Ask
- **For investors:** $X for 18-24 months runway; GTM + infra scale.
- **For partners:** distribution + LTS slugs; co-sell plays; OEM pilots in 2 verticals.

---

## Appendix (optional)
Additional supporting materials:
- Detailed SLOs per modality
- Policy language examples
- Data flow diagrams
- Reference pricing table

---

## KPIs & Dashboards to Run the Business
- **Growth:** Signups, SDK installs, first success in 24h, example runs/user.
- **Adoption:** Active orgs, keys per org, flows/org, multi-slug usage %.
- **Reliability:** Error budget burn, p95/99 by slug, incident MTTD/MTTR.
- **Economics:** Cost/1k tx by modality, cache hit rate, reserved vs on-demand mix.
- **Sales:** PQL→SQL→Win rates, time-to-POC, time-to-go-live, expansion ACV.
